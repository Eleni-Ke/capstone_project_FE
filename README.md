# Book Writing Application Front end

## Overview

This is the front end of a book writing application. Users can create characters, places, and storylines to help organize their writing process. They will also be able to download the different parts.

## The main features will be:

1. Creating, editing and deleting characters (plus images)
2. Creating, editing and deleting places (plus images)
3. Creating the skeleton of the story in very short parts
4. A map section
5. A tool to visualize and change the relationships between the characters and places.
6. Maybe a section for inspirational music or smells...
7. A main section to write the book.

## Installation

To install the application, clone the repository and run npm install to install dependencies. Then run npm start to start.

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can create new characters, places, and storylines. They can also view, edit, and delete existing ones. The application also includes a section for writing the actual book. The sections will be reachable with a navbar. The images and colors will be interchangeable so that the users can adapt them to the style and mood of the book.

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables to connect to the backend. Please refer to the .env.example file for more information.

## Dependencies

- React
- Redux
- React-Router-Dom
- Bootstrap
- TypeScript

## Testing

There will be tests. To run them enter npm run test.

## Deployment

There will be more details here.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
